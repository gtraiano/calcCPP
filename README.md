# calcCPP
A very simple calculator.
Parses an expression string and extracts operators and operands.
No use of syntax tree, thus limited capabilities (nesting, priority etc.)

Input accepts
- integer / decimal numbers
- arithmetic operators: `+ - * / ^`
- commands: `store recall clear help`

Parses only simple expressions (i.e. no parentheses and no operators priority).
